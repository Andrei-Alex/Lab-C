# Explanation of Pointer Usage in C

This document explains the use of pointers in a C program through a specific example.

## C Code Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int pointer() {
    // Declare an integer variable 'a' and initialize it to 100
    int a = 100;

    // Print the value of 'a'
    printf("a = %d\n", a);

    // Print the memory address of 'a' using the address-of operator '&'
    printf("adresa a: %p\n", &a);

    // Declare a pointer to an integer 'pa' and initialize it with the address of 'a'
    int *pa = &a;

    // Print the memory address stored in the pointer 'pa'
    printf("*pa = %p\n", (void *)pa);

    // Dereference the pointer 'pa' and change the value of 'a' to 120
    *pa = 120;

    // Print the new value of 'a'
    printf("a = %d\n", a);
}
```
*Note: Simple example.*

## What is a Pointer ?

We can store this memory address in a special type of variable, called a "pointer". A pointer is defined using the * character and must include the type of the variable it points to.

- A pointer is a special type of variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

- A pointer knows exactly the position where the storage of a variable in memory begins. A pointer knows exactly the number of bytes used in the storage of variables. This is possible because pointers are defined together with the type of variable they point to.

- The actual size of a pointer (the variable of the pointer type) is always the same, regardless of the type of variable it points to.

- A pointer can be incremented or decremented, moving from the beginning of one variable to the beginning of the next (or previous). This is called "pointer arithmetic".

- A pointer can be used to obtain the value of the variable it points to. This operation is called dereferencing.

## More info?

A pointer in C is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers are used for various purposes in C programming, including accessing array elements, passing variables by reference to functions, and dynamic memory allocation. They are a powerful feature of the language that allows for efficient and flexible handling of data structures.

- **Declaration:** A pointer is declared by specifying the data type it points to, followed by an asterisk (`*`). For example, `int *p;` declares a pointer to an integer.
- **Initialization:** A pointer is usually initialized to the address of a variable using the address-of operator (`&`). For example, `p = &variable;`.
- **Dereferencing:** Accessing the value at the address a pointer points to is called dereferencing. This is done using the dereference operator (`*`). For example, `*p` would yield the value of the variable that `p` points to.
- **Pointer Arithmetic:** C allows arithmetic operations on pointers, like adding or subtracting integers, which is used to traverse arrays or other sequential data structures.

Pointers are a fundamental aspect of C programming and are crucial for understanding how the language works under the hood.
