/**
 * @brief Function to demonstrate the use of pointers in C.
 *
 * This function showcases how a pointer can be used to manipulate the value
 * of a variable stored in memory. It declares an integer variable, prints its
 * value and memory address, and then uses a pointer to modify its value.
 * The new value of the variable is then printed to demonstrate the change.
 *
 * This serves as an example of pointer declaration, initialization,
 * dereferencing for value modification, and basic pointer arithmetic.
