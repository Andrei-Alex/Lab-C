# Exercise Management System Documentation

## Overview

This system allows the running of different exercises based on user input. It includes functionality to list all available exercises and to run a selected exercise by name.

## Files

- **exercisesMap.h**: Header file that declares the `ExerciseMap` structure and functions related to exercise management.
- **guessTheNumber.h**: Header file for the "Guess the Number" game logic.

## Functions

### `printAvailableExercise`

**Synopsis**: Lists all available exercises to the standard output.

**Usage**:
```c
void printAvailableExercise();
```

**Description**: Iterates over the `exerciseList` array and prints each exercise's name. The exercises are numbered in the order they appear in the array.

### `runExerciseByName`

**Synopsis**:
```c
void runExerciseByName(const char* name);
```

**Parameters**:
- `name`: A string representing the name of the exercise to run.

**Description**: Looks for an exercise with the given name in the `exerciseList` array. If found, it runs the exercise's associated function. If not found, it prints "Exercise not found.".

## Structures

### `ExerciseMap`

**Description**: A structure to map the name of an exercise to its corresponding function.

**Fields**:
- `name`: A string representing the name of the exercise.
- `func`: A function pointer to the exercise's main function.

## Arrays

### `exerciseList`

**Description**: An array of `ExerciseMap` items. Each item associates an exercise name with its corresponding function.

**Example Initialization**:
```c
ExerciseMap exerciseList[] = {
    {"Guess", guessTheNumber},
};
```

## Compilation and Usage

To compile and run the system, ensure that you have all related files and a proper C compiler set up. Compile the source files together, linking them with necessary libraries. After compilation, run the executable and follow the prompts to interact with the exercise system.

## Developer Notes

- **Maintainability**: When adding new exercises, ensure to add a corresponding `ExerciseMap` entry in the `exerciseList`.
- **Scalability**: For a large number of exercises, consider more scalable data structures or generating the list dynamically.
- **Reliability**: Ensure that the exercise functions are robust and handle user input safely and effectively.
